# Python-learning-package
This package is intended for anyone wanting to learn how to program in Python quickly and get started on a web scraping project. Originally made as a 
supplement to my RCM 200 speech, this learning package is fit for anyone, including absolute beginners, to get started with Python.

What's included:
- This README file
- A file containing important links
- A folder containing thenewboston's example files that he goes through in his crash course video
- job_scraper.py example web scraper program

My advice for using this package:
1. Watch thenewboston's crash course video on fundamental Python concepts (syntax, variables, data types, using numbers, operators, loops, and more)
   link is provided in the links.txt
2. For clarification/brush up, read w3school's Python reference whose link I provided in the links.txt
3. Play around with the example files. Each example file is related to a fundamental Python concept. Familiarize yourself with these concepts
4. Once you're comfortable with Python, watch the web scraping tutorial video found in the links.txt and look into the job_scraper program that I provide 
   and see if you can understand the code. You can use this program as a base for your own job scraper
