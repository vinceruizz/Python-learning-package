# Python-learning-package
This package is intended for anyone wanting to learn how to program in Python quickly and get started on a web scraping project. Originally made as a 
supplement to my RCM 200 speech, this learning package is fit for anyone, including absolute beginners, to get started with Python.

My advice for using this package:
1. Watch thenewboston's crash course video on fundamental Python concepts (syntax, variables, data types, using numbers, operators, loops, and more)
2. For clarification/brush up, read w3school's Python reference
3. Play around with the example files that I provide
4. Once you're comfortable with Python, look into the job_scraper program that I provide and see if you can understand the code. You can use this program
   as a base for your own job scraper
